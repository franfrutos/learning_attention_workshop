    "text": "About\n\nThis advanced workshop offers an afternoon of talks and discussion on how learning and attention shape human cognition and behavior. The aim is to bring together students and researchers interested in these topics and to provide an accessible but research-oriented overview of current work in the field.\nThe programme combines several invited talks with a closing lecture by Professor Mike Le Pelley, covering topics such as:\n\nLearning and attention in humans\n\nThe automatically of visual statistical learning\nExperimental research in human habits\nThe role of mind wandering in implicit statistical learning\n\nThe event is in person, free of charge, and especially intended for:\n\nMaster’s and PhD students in psychology, cognitive science, and related areas\n\nEarly-career researchers interested in attention, learning, and decision making\n\nParticipants who register via the registration form will receive a certificate of attendance."

    "text": "Speaker\nDr. David Luque\nUniversity of Málaga, Málaga, Spain\nDavid Luque is “Profesor Titular” (Senior Lecturer) at the department of basic Psychology, Universidad de Málaga. His research interests are related to how humans learn new habits and how/when habits interfere with goal-directed actions and attention. He has pioneered in the use of a range of techniques and dependent variables (Response Time, EEG, eye gaze) for studying the habit system. Dr Luque has been 3 years working as a Senior Researcher Fellow at UNSW Sydney (Australia, 2013), and 4 years at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Researcher Attraction Grant, 2018). He has attracted more than €1M in funding for research as PI, from the Australian Research Council, the AEI, and the Research Agencies from the region of Madrid and Andalusia. His research has been published in prestigious journals (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General; Journal of Neuroscience; eLife). Dr Luque is very involved in Open Science. All the experiments coming from his research team are preregistered; all data, materials, and analysis code are openly shared (320 entris in OSF). He has been awarded with the “Preregistration Challenge Prize” (Center for Open Science, 2017) and the Team Credibility Prize for being a part of the #EEGManyLabs project (British Neuroscience Association, 2023)."
